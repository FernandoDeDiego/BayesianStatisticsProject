To install the package which I called MYpackage, you need to install first the devtools package (and don't forget to run library(devtools));
maybe also you might need (not sure, also I'm not using Rstudio right now) to download from the web and install the latest version of Rtools.
At this point if you setwd("...") in the directory that contains the MYpackage folder, you just need to run install("MYpackage").
